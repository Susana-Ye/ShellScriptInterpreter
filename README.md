<h1>🖥️ Scripter: Linux Shell Script Interpreter [C Project]</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demo & Output Samples]()

<h2>📝 Description</h2>
Scripter is a command interpreter written in C for Linux, designed to emulate core functionalities of a shell as part of an Operating Systems lab. It reads a script file line-by-line, interprets and executes each command using POSIX system calls. The project reinforces understanding of process management, file descriptor manipulation, piping, I/O redirection, and background execution.
<br>
The interpreter also supports an external command (mygrep), developed as a C program that mimics grep functionality, searching for strings within files.

<h2>🛠️ Languages and Utilities Used</h2>
