<h1>🎮 Shell Script Interpreter [Python Project]</h1>

 ### [YouTube Playthrough Demonstration](https://youtu.be/jkXYtZbMatM)

<h2>📝 Description</h2>
This project is a simplified recreation of the classic 1983 Mario Bros. arcade game, developed in Python using object-oriented programming. The game features 4 levels, each with a mix of 10 enemies and coins emerging from pipes. The player controls Mario, who must defeat all enemies in each stage to advance.

The game includes platforming mechanics, enemy behavior, collision detection, and animations. Mario starts with 3 lives, and winning the game requires completing all levels without losing them. The code is structured into multiple classes (Mario, Enemy, Level, Floor, etc.), emphasizing modular design and real-time interaction handling.
